# Mortgage Price Predictor

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a Mortgage Price Predictor using mortgage data from the USA. It is developed by [Zaeem Ul Islam](https://github.com/mightyflavor/) and [Ahmed Abdullah](https://github.com/ahmedembeddedx). The goal of this project is to provide an accurate prediction of mortgage prices, which can be valuable for homebuyers, real estate professionals, and financial institutions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://kaggle.com/datasets/75cacaff0f013e5f3248d463f42314e767e22d3bb8c9c34a2621cb96b7c82998). It includes various features related to mortgages, such as loan amount, interest rate, property type, location, and more. The dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: We obtained the dataset from [source] and performed data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Data Exploration**: We analyzed the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, and potential patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**: We selected and engineered relevant features for model training.

4. **Model Building**: We implemented machine learning algorithms to build the mortgage price prediction model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We assessed the model's performance using various evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.

6. **Deployment**: We deployed the model as a user-friendly web application for end-users to predict mortgage prices.
